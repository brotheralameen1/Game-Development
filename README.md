This repository will contain information on games that I develop and release.

I mainly use Cordova as my Framework for these games, so yeah. 

This repository will mainly contain the Source Code of the games that I develop and the APK Files to install these games. Since some of these games will be for PC as well, the EXE Files or links to download will be provided, if file is too large to be uploaded to GitHub. For any web-based games, HTML Files will be provided or links will be given if they can't uploaded to GitHub due to size restrictions.

Peace
