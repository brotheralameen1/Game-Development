This game has been a game I've been working with since about 2 Years Ago before Ahmad Saleh from Doxbin decided to hack into my computer and delete my entire Operating System.

While this game itself is quite old in itself, I had managed to backup the code to the Cordova Cloud IDE which is why I have access to the code for the game today. Here, I present to you, AKM Chocolate Milk Game Source Code; I recommend that you use the necessary tools to check the code if you'd like such as a Cordova IDE or Notepad++

Peace.
