It came into my mind that I should make a horror game for Android from scratch, which gave me the idea of having to make a game called the AKM Chocolate Milk Game.

The name, character, gameplay and sound of this game derived from two games that I played that were from the Dark Web. One of these games was called Sad Satan while the other one was called Chocolate Milk. Both these games that I downloaded were made out from the Unity Game Engine, so I thought maybe I could make a 2D Version of these creepy games that would be more fun to play and came up with the AKM Chocolate Milk Game that's made in Cordova.

To play this game, you'd require some good headphones and to be playing at during the night so as to get the jumpscares that you would expect in a horror scene of the game itself. There are keys and elements that you have to collect, monsters you have to kill and much more. All has been explained in the games "How to play?" Menu once you open the game. Please note that if you do get killed or fail at some point again, you'll have to start over again from Level 1.

This game has 7 Levels and pretty high level graphics so be sure you have time during the night to play this game when you can. Peace.
