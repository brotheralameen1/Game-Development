This will be a Wave Defense Game specifically designed for Windows and Linux PCs. 

It kind of has a mixture of a horror and normal 2D Shooter Game Theme. The Sprites were taken from a different source and edited to suit my behalf of making a good horror game.

In this game, all enemies have 3 Lives and they shouldn't reach the inverted cross in the middle. You use use the mouse to navigate the player, and left click to shoot. All enemies within the game move towards the inverted cross of the Satanic Temple Room.
