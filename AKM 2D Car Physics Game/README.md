This will be my last game that I will ever program as I will have to focus on other future cyber-security projects. This game only uses the left and right keys and it's a short, one leveled game. Source Code will be given and this game will only be available for Windows and Linux. You can however use the Source Code to build the game for other platforms using Cordova. This game can be built for Android, iOS and HTML5 as well. Always consider credit to the developer and his crypto-wallets being left on the game, if you're going to make any changes to the code of the game, or to better the game, or deciding to release it for other platforms.
