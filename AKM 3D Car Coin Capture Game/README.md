This is a game released for PC Versions for Linux and Windows. In this game, you simply need to go round and collect the necessary coins. You can use your up, down, left and right keys to either slow down, speed up, move left or move right in the game. The release of this game is final and there will be no more releases after this, this will be my last 3D Game I will ever develop.

If you're a developer and would like to take the source code of the game to build your own version of the game or build the game for other platforms such as Android, iOS and Web then you can go ahead. Please leave the credit to the original developer (me) and leave any crypto-addresses. You could add your crypto-address and name on the game, as long as mine are left there. Please don't forget to contribute to the development project as it really helps fund other upcoming projects.
