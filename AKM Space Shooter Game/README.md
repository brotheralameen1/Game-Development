This is the first game that I ever developed in the Cordova Framework. It's a normal Space Shooter Game and it was rejected over three times before it could be accepted into market after the final build was made.

At the moment, since theres not much downloads and usage for the game, ads have been disabled on Adsense, but you can still play the game and it'll work good. Give it a try.
