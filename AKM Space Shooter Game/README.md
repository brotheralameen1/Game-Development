This is the first game that I ever developed in the Cordova Framework. It's a normal Space Shooter Game and it was rejected over three times before it could be accepted into market after the final build was made.

At the moment, since theres not much downloads and usage for the game, ads have been disabled on Adsense, but you can still play the game and it'll work good. Give it a try.

The same game can be accessed from here: https://brotheralameen.itch.io/akm-space-shooter-game

While I don't have the Cordova Source Code that was used to develop this app from the Cordova Framework, the Source Code of the APK File itself will be extracted later and put here (This was because my PC was hacked by Ahmad Saleh from Doxbin whose from Syria mainly, and he had deleted my entire Operating System back when I was working on Game Development work about 2 Years Ago and I'm now deciding to go back to it for a while just for fun and to build my reputation as a Developer with my GitHub as well). 

Nonetheless, there's several proof that this app is indeed mine and the Xiaomi Market has my credentials to my Cordova Developer Account that was used to publish the build for this game. This game itself was built from scratch.
